# Introduction:

There are two programs coded in Matlab (version 2010 or newer) here:

## ddmin_2014Nov17.m

This code calculates the minimum distance of approach from zc versus A curves in dynamic AFM. 

For example zc vector and A vector create:

dmin=zc-A

It also calculates the vectors:

1. **ddm_clean**  This is the vector after removing outliers 

2. **distance_dWA** This vector has the distances from the local maxima in A

3. **height_dWA** This vector has the height in m at local maxima in A 


## ProcessZeroTriangle.m

Sometimes the above vectors will not include the feature of local maxima reported in:

V. Barcons, A. Verdaguer, J. Font, M. Chiesa, and S. Santos, Journal of Physical Chemistry C 116, 7757 (2012).


In these cases running this program will generate new vectors at a cut-off of dmin (that needs to be selected by inspection of the user) to select the
curves that present local maxima in A only. 

Vectors are:

1. **new_ddm**

2. **new_distance_dAW**

3. **new_height_dAW**

The number of excluded vectors is stored in the variable:

counter_removals


# STEPS

1. Place files already in standard form into the folder **Files**

2. If you dont have them into single files process them with the code [here](https://github.com/FSDataAnalysis/PreProcessFiles).

3. Run the ddmin code and the files will be processed. 


There are two vectors. 1) **ddm** and 2) **ddm_clean**. The second vector does not include outliers.
