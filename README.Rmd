# Introduction:

This code calculates the minimum distance of approach from zc versus A curves in dynamic AFM. 

For example zc vector and A vector create:

dmin=zc-A

# STEPS

1. Place files already in standard form into the folder **Files**

2. If you dont have them into single files process them with the code [here](https://github.com/FSDataAnalysis/PreProcessFiles).

3. Run the ddmin code and the files will be processed. 


There are two vectors. 1) **ddm** and 2) **ddm_clean**. The second vector does not include outliers.
